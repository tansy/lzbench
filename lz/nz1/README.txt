DESCRIPTION
-----------
NZ1 (NanoZip version 1) is a minimalist, dependency-free data compression algorithm
focused on balancing compression ratio, speed, and portability. Written in pure C99,
it features universal SIMD support for x86 (AVX2/SSE2) and ARM (NEON) architectures,
and includes built-in data validation with CRC32 checksums.

KEY FEATURES
------------
- Compact code (~500 lines)
- High compression and decompression speed (up to 2.8 GB/s compress, 4.2 GB/s decompress)
- Configurable sliding window (1KB to 1MB)
- Safety: full buffer boundary checks and CRC validation
- Zero dependencies, easy to embed in embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Supports text, binary, and high-entropy data well

USE CASES
---------
NZ1 is perfect for applications where low memory footprint, speed, and safety are
critical, such as:

- Embedded systems (microcontrollers, IoT devices)
- Mobile and handheld devices
- Real-time data streaming and logging
- Games and game engines (for assets compression and fast decompression)
- Firmware update packages
- Any environment with limited CPU/memory resources and strict reliability needs
